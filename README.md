# hello-world
Just another respository
It is polite, when introducing yourself, to say "hello."

"Hello."

"I will not mention my name here as we are just meeting each other. For now, you can know me as LinuxGamer. I chose this moniker because I enjoy using linux and learning linux and playing around with linux, that I chose "Linux...". I chose the moniker gamer because of the same reasons. Therefore, I am known as "LinuxGamer." Although, this is not whom I am. These are the things that I enjoy.

Who I am is a different question entirely. Generally speaking, telling someone "who" you are signifies a deeper connection of trust and friendship. We do not have that. But I would be remiss if I didn't tell you my primary identity. Not because I trust you, but because of the command/encouragement given me to tell others. I am a Christian.

Many people offer various different interpretations to what this means. However, to understand Jesus is to be a Christian. This confession of Jesus comes in two clear ways that is not dependent upon me or "my views." The teaching of Jesus transcends all human boundaries but is given in human language. This language comes from God's Word, Holy Scripture or Holy Writ. For those that believe in this Word as I do, this is the first confession of Jesus. The second, and not any less significant, is the confession as it is taught by those who have come before me . . . leading all the way back to Jesus Himself, and is summed up in two words: The Church.

Now, I understand that many people do not accept the Church's teaching as valid because many people think that what's important is their views on Jesus. However, this is a crass way of thinking and unprofitable to any person seeking to not hold a self-centered religion or life. If life is all about you or me and we live this way, then everything is ultimately up to us and there is no significant thing known as truth. Truth because self-centered and something that is allowed to change from one person to another.

If this has been your way of thinking, I urge you to strongly consider how you are setting up your life. And to consider what you are currently experiencing in life. Are you setting up a flimsy construct that will rob you of all joy or happiness in life. Because it is inevitable for people who live this way to become lost in despair. It's quite easy to go down this path. This is our natural inclination. Let me show you.

You get fired from your job. Your spouse leaves you. Your children resent you. If truth is relative to the individual, then you've either done nothing wrong, which equals you being alone because everyone else's truth excludes you. Or, everything is your fault. You're the reason for the problems. Your truth now becomes your worst enemy. This way of thinking, that truth is relative to each individual is faulty, flawed, and will inevitably lead to your destruction - quite possibly self-destruction.

But if there is a truth out there. Then it has to be one that can be traced, allocated, explored, learned, and shared with others. It has to be something understandable, even if it cannot be fully understood/comprehended. Just because something is partially or fully incomprehensible on a cognitive level, does not mean it is not true. The average person cannot tell you how an internal combustion engine works. Far fewer, can tell you the specifics. Even less, know enough about it to troubleshoot or fix your problems. But most of us spend large amounts of money on these vehicles just to enjoy driving on roads and whatnot. The internet is also a great example. Even the best techno genius' can't explain every aspect (maybe some can, but I have never met them - see that also proves the point) of the internet. Yet, we all use it as a major time consumer of ours.

What this means for individuals living in each decade or period in history, is that we have to see if we will live a self-centered life; placing our own, often "depressing," truth as lord and master. Or, we have to acknowledge that truth is outside of ourselves and seek it out with everything that we've got.

It goes, quite understandly, that if truth is outside of ourselves; then, it must be known to the rest of the world. It has to have a paper trail. It has to be old. It has to be complete. Even if we can't understand aspects of it fully, or partially, that does not mean that it isn't true.

Now some people that this approach and they live life not investigating or finding the truth; but making everything equally true or combining what they think to be true with finding things that agree with their previous conclusion. This, also, is not seeking out the truth but merely covering up our self-centered, self-truth in pretty cloths so that people will validate us. Here is some piece of truth from history: truth is often dirty and bloody. When we here about how great a country is because they done this or that; often cover up the truth of the situation. The phrase, "history is written by the victors," come to mind. That also is not truth. Or, at least, the full truth. To seek out truth is to be interested in discovering the full truth, for partial truth is a fancy way of saying "lies."

I can guess what you're thinking...wow...this guy is full of himself. But, ironically (yes, I did use this word correctly), all I did was give you a glimpse of the truth.

The truth about Jesus is testified by Holy Scripture and by the Church. The teaching have been passed down from Jesus to the Apostle's through the various clergyman unto today. Not all Christian pastors can claim this statement, because their denomination does not hold to the ancient confessions of the early church; or they pick and choose and follow a mixed viewpoint (again, that's the self-centered truth dressed up to look pretty). Not to harp too much on them, for many get the basics right, but there is enough of the falsehood remaining to make being a Christian from those walks very difficult and depressing.

Let's be clear: God's Word does state that "anyone who calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved" (Acts 2). Therefore, all "Christians" who call upon the name of the Lord "will be saved." It is not right for one Christian denomination to state that just because you don't agree with them in everything equals being outside of Christ's salvation. On the other hand, to be geniune in seeking out the truth - or, to put it another way: to be a deligent student of the truth; - we must acknowledge the teachings as they are presented in all of their forms, and discover why certain aspects were emphasized and while others were denied, or still others allowed but which is not given a lot of study.

When this realization comes to mind, then seeing Christianity from the perspective of the Church - that is, the early Church - must be given a valid reading.

That's why I said at the beginning that "this confession of Jesus comes in two clear ways that is not dependent upon me or "my views." [but upon God's Word and the Church]."

Thank you. I hope you found this illunimating and helpful. God's peace be yours in Christ Jesus with the Father and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever. Amen
